class variations are:
1.  Hunter: Asbrand Shadowbrace,
2.  Elementalist: Xorag Stormreaver,
3.  Theif: brat mi tam si,      
4.  Engineer: brat mi tam si,   
5.  Necromancer: brat mi tam si,
6.  Guardian: brat mi tam si,   
7.  Revenant: somebody,
8.  Mesmer: somebody
    
Short hand, I think that each class can have masteries, and depending on the points you have invested on the specified skill tree, you will earn spells or minions
